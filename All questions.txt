  // let promise1 = new Promise((resolve) => {
  //   setTimeout(() => {
  //     resolve("Resolved After 100 ms");
  //   }, 100);
  // });
  // let promise2 = Promise.resolve("First rejected");
  // let promise3 = Promise.reject("Second rejected");

  // let retuendPromise = Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]);
  // retuendPromise.then(values =>{
  //   console.log(values);
  // }).catch(e=>{
  //   console.log(e)
  // });
